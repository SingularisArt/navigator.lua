- [x]  Changed key maps
    - Add fallback to key maps e.g. if `gD` does not find a type declaraion, it will fallback to `gD`
      which is default key map go to global declaration
  - `gt`: removed `gt` mapping and prefer `<space>D`

- [ ]  Changed key maps
  I plan to change the mapping for following key maps as it conflicts with other vim default key maps
    - `gp`: changed to `<Leader>gp`
  - `gP`: changed to `<Leader>gP`
